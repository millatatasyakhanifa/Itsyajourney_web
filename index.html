                    <img src="assets/image/hobbies-gardening.jpg" class="content-image" alt="hobbies">
                    <p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has limited activities outside the home, I have been given interest again in my old hobby. That's right, gardening is an old hobby of mine - which I left behind because of other things. I started gardening again by planting flowers to enliven the garden in front of the house.</p>
                    <p>And what I'm happy about is that my grandmother came home from my brother's house with lots of strawberry trees (that's my favorite fruit). I am very enthusiastic about caring for the strawberry plant so that it thrives and bears lots of fruit. This long-lost atmosphere of fun is back again making me very happy. And gardening is indeed a fun and rewarding hobby. So let's try gardening and reap the benefits.</p>

                <h2>Photography</h2>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Photography is one of the things I like. I'll show you guys, so we'll see the results of my photos related to the theme of food-photography, nature-photography (flora, fauna, or landscape), and street photography. If you are interested in my portrait result, please write your request in the <a href="#ask">Ask Me</a> feature.</p>

                    <img src="assets/image/food-photograpy.jpg" class="content-image" alt="food_photography">
                    <p>Indonesian traditional food - sour plum or commonly called Asam boi by Indonesian people. Asam boi is made from dried plums. This food is also known as traditional Chinese food. If you want to try this food, you can buy it at the traditional market, especially Glodok market. There are still many traders who sell Asam boi.</p>

                    <p>White roses are starting to bloom in the garden. I took this photo when I returned to my hometown. The natural areas that are still preserved in my hometown make it easy for me to find lots of fresh plants. This white rose is one of the plants in the garden in front of my house. Isn't it beautiful?</p>

                    <img src="assets/image/book1.jpg" class="content-image" alt="review">
                    <p>This book by Ichiro Kishimi & Fumitake Koga is the first book I would like to recommend to you. In addition to the unique title, the contents of this book are also very interesting. This book contains a conversation between a philosopher and a young man who discusses Adler's psychological theory. Although it deals with philosophical theory, this book is quite easy to understand.</p>
